# Introduction

Have you ever shared a secret (such as a token or password) with a colleague? Have you felt that the way you share them is a little insecure? ðŸ‘€

It is common to see cases where passwords or credentials are shared through insecure channels that are easy to hack ðŸ˜µ There are ways to create secure channels but they are not very intuitive for non-developers ðŸ¤•

This is what Quicknote was created for! A secure channel where you can share your secrets quickly, easily and safely.

# What is Quicknote?

Based on [Privnote](https://privnote.com/), Quicknote is a open source app that helps to create and share volatile messages which only text is allowed. This app is perfect to quickly share passwords, private tokens, private credentials and gossip :).
